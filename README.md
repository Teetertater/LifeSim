# Evolution Simulation by Yury Zhuk, Summer 2019
A Simulated Population of Lifeforms that Reproduce and Evolve   

Lifeforms consume energy with every step.   
Dark horizontal lines represent food. Lifeforms walking over the lines will gain energy.   
Mutations occur occasionally, a mutant Lifeform will take on a new colour.   


Start menu is controlled by arrow keys and return/enter.
Try various start parameters to see their effects.

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------| ------------|
| Maximum Lifespan:            | The Lifeforms will not live beyond this age even if they have enough energy                | 
| Target population:           | This is an approximate control of the average population. The energy value of the food is affected by the value set here (higher target --> food gives more energy)                  | 
| Energy Consumption/Step:     | A Lifeform making one step will consume this amount of energy                              | 
| Energy Required for Birth:   | The minimum energy required for both parents to produce an offspring | 
| Energy at Birth:             | The amount of energy each Lifeform starts with| 
| Energy Used for Mating:      | The amount used by both parents to create an offspring| 
| Min Age of Reproduction:     | Mating cannot occur before both parents have taken this many steps | 
| Reproduction Cooldown(Steps):| The number of steps a Lifeform must take between producing subsequent offspring | 
| Mutation Rate:               | Number of mutations that the Lifeform will undergo in its lifetime | 

In-game controls:
  * Pause/Resume: Left/Right
  * Speed up/Slowdown: Up/Down
  * Mouseover displays information about a Lifeform.
